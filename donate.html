<p>Here is our cheat sheet for why you should consider giving a gift to a charity that gives all year-round:</p>
<p>Our favorite reason:the services and supports provided to us by the Autism Speaks' supported Autism Treatment Network. The ATN is comprised of a network of hospitals, physicians, researchers and families at 14 sites across the US and Canada.  Philadelphias ATN led us to our sons developmental pediatrician, Dr. Amanda Bennett, who I am quite certain has saved our sanity on several occasions with her expertise and compassion. I cannot recommend the ATNs highly enough.</p>
<p>The Autism Research Foundation is the first medically-accredited autism research charity in the world. Our longevity proves we have stood the test of time as a trusted authority in the field.
<p>We believe donations should pass through us, not to us. Whether you donate to research or a conference or anything in between your donation makes an immediate impact on the community we serve.
</p>
<p>The people who work for Autism Speaks. I had the pleasure of meeting a number of employees when I spoke at the kick-off for the Philadelphia walk. You could not ask for more compassionate, knowledgable and kind individuals, and each one was so devoted to helping individuals with autism and their families. I loved talking to the families, but finally getting to personally interact with the folks from Autism Speaks was one of the highlights of the evening for me.
