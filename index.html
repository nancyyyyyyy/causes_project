        Autism Awareness Month is a time to educate your community about autism and Light It Up Blue! Spreading autism awareness in schools is a great way to celebrate April and promote inclusion and acceptance in the classroom and beyond.

        "Awareness" is becoming a bad word in some autism/disability groups. Some are asserting that parents aren't supposed to talk or write about a disability that isn't their own, an argument that completely disregards the reality that some of our children may not ever be able to advocate for themselves. We are not mommy martyrs for telling about the hard days. We are not objectifying those with disabilities to make us feel better about ourselves when we share stories of accommodation and acceptance.

    <p>Our goal is simple: to improve the lives of all Australians on the autism spectrum and the families who love them.</p>

    <p>We empower parents and carers with quality information and resources. We provide targeted educational programs to families, professionals and the broader community. We support inclusion for people on the autism spectrumâ€¦ and we have some fun along the way too.</p>

    <p>sWe know that families are the best advocates for their children, and we are here to ensure they have access to the best quality information and supports to help them along the way.</p>
